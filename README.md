# Tic-Tac-Os
*Play Tic-Tac-Toe against random strangers on the Internet!!*

## Purpose
We wanted to make an interative web app and also challenege ourselves on our very first web app. 
We decided that a Tic-Tac-Toe game will be our very first app because of the complexity of being able to 
track each user's move, being able to determine the winning combination and it is also fun!!

## Tech Used

* HTML
* CSS 
* JQuery
* Firebase

An interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that you can play against other people in the world. 
The game will be using HTML & CSS for the interface. 
The logic of the game will be created using javascript with additional functionality of Google Firebase to allow it to be multiplayer.
